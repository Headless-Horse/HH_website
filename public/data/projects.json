      "description": "Trusted with the task of introducing LYMA, a revolutionary luxury supplement, we took on the roles of designing its debut packaging, crafting its web presence, and establishing its distinctive brand identity. Despite facing various challenges, we managed to successfully deliver initial launch advertisements, innovative packaging designs, and compelling media content.<br>Headless Horse took charge of website design, curated social media content, and early packaging concepts, leading to prominent features in Vogue Paris, Harper's Bazaar, and Elle. Coined as 'the Bulgari of supplements' by The Evening Standard, our endeavours not only piqued global interest and captivated influential figures but also rapidly generated millions in startup value within a remarkably brief span of 12 months.",
