The revised packaging shows a handful of carefully considered details from the revised wordmark, the introduction of a new insignia, typographic updates and material updates, including a new recyclable wooden cap and FSC recycled paper produced domestically in Italy. A detail we are incredibly proud of is the culmination of many hours of research and development to create the new flower detail on the box. Founder Erb. Dipl. Dr. Joseph Franz during his research has collected flower presses from the laboratories’ gardens since 1986 in a library called the Herbarium. We have taken scans of the flowers and created 1:1 embossings of these pressing them into the packaging for a tactile finish and meeting the objective of eliminating coloured inks from the product packaging.",
