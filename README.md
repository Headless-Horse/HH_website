## About

The website of Headless Horse: an independent, Edinburgh-based, full-service creative studio working at the intersection of art, design and technology.

### Design

The site was designed to showcase all past works together in equal hierarchy; to allow viewers to spend time to investigate the studioâ€™s body of work. Headless Horse looks to meld modern and traditional processes; we communicated this through employing the use of a still life featuring past works from imagery, sculpture and other studio properties. The photograph is an interaction point whereby moving a cursor around the wall you can discover project titles, that once selected open full length case studies in a window-like modal.
